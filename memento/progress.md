# Progress: Express.js Boilerplate

## 1. What Works

- **User Registration:** New users can sign up.
- **User Login:** Existing users can log in and receive a JWT.
- **Authentication Middleware:** A middleware exists to protect routes by verifying JWTs.
- **Basic Project Structure:** A modular structure is in place with a clear separation of concerns.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Authorization:** A role-based authorization system needs to be implemented. This includes:
  - Updating the user model to include roles.
  - Creating an authorization middleware to check user roles.
  - Protecting specific routes based on user roles.
- **Code Improvements:** Refactor the existing code for better readability, performance, and adherence to best practices.
- **Documentation:** The `README.md` and other documentation need to be updated.

## 3. Known Issues

- None identified yet. The analysis phase will uncover any potential issues.
