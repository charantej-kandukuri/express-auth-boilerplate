# Product Context: Express.js Boilerplate

## 1. Problem Statement

Developers frequently spend significant time setting up foundational features like user authentication and authorization for new projects. This repetitive work slows down the development process and can lead to inconsistent implementations.

## 2. Solution

This boilerplate provides a ready-to-use Express.js application with a secure and robust implementation of user authentication. The goal is to offer a standardized, well-documented starting point that allows developers to focus on building core application features instead of boilerplate infrastructure.

## 3. User Experience Goals

- **Effortless Setup:** Developers should be able to get a new project running with a single command.
- **Clear Documentation:** The codebase and its features must be thoroughly documented, making it easy to understand and extend.
- **Flexible & Extensible:** The boilerplate should be structured in a modular way, allowing developers to easily add, remove, or modify features to fit their specific needs.
