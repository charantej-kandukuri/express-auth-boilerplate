# Active Context: Express.js Boilerplate

## 1. Current Focus

The immediate goal is to analyze the existing codebase to understand its current state. This analysis will form the basis for implementing the authorization feature and identifying potential improvements.

## 2. Next Steps

1.  **Code Review:** Read through the key files related to authentication, user management, and routing to understand the current implementation.
2.  **Identify Authorization Gaps:** Determine where and how to add role-based authorization.
3.  **Plan Implementation:** Create a plan for adding the authorization middleware and updating the user model.
4.  **Update `README.md`:** Revise the `README.md` to reflect the project's structure and setup instructions.

## 3. Key Questions to Answer

- How is the `auth.middleware.ts` currently used?
- What is the structure of the `user.model.ts`? Does it support roles?
- How are routes protected?
- What improvements can be made to the existing code?
